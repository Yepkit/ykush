# YKUSH Command Application


Control application for Yepkit YKUSH Switchable USB Hub boards.


Description
===========

Console application developed to illustrate the programmatic control of YKUSH family boards capabilities.
It executes one command per run, being appropriate to be executed as a console command.
But it can be easily adapted to execute a work-flow with multiple commands and we encourage you to alter it to best fit your needs.

The implementation makes use of libusb for Linux builds and hidapi for macOS and Windows.
For Linux and macOS we include a build and installation script, `build.sh` and `install.sh` respectively, for building and installing the application. 


Boards Supported
================
- [YKUSH](https://www.yepkit.com/products/ykush)

Building
========

The steps for building on Linux, macOS and Windows are detailed bellow.


Linux
-----

For Linux `libusb-1.0` must be installed. For Debian based systems run the following.
```
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
```
With these dependencies installed, build the application the running the following script.
```
./build.sh
```

After a successful build process you can install the ykush command in the system. To do so, run:
```
sudo ./install.sh
```

After install, the `ykushcmd` command is ready for use.


macOS
-----

For macOS `hidapi` must be installed. It can be installed with brew with
```
brew install hidapi
```

With these dependencies installed, build the application the running the following script.
```
./build.sh
```

After a successful build process you can install the ykush command in the system. To do so, run:
```
sudo ./install.sh
```

After install, the `ykushcmd` command is ready for use.



Windows
-------

To build using MinGW run the following command.

For 32bit:
```
make -f Makefile_win32
```

For 64bit:
```
make -f Makefile_win64
```

After a successful build process the executable file will be created in the `bin\Win32` or `bin\Win64` folder depending if it was the 32 or 64 bit build.
